	Things I Learned
      </h2>
      
      <p>
	Linux is an Operating System (OS) that takes a very bare-bones approach to letting the user interact with the system. <br>
	You can read and write files which can be used to create programs to run applications (apps). One application is EMACS, a text editor that provides easier access to editing files, and even program other things using seperate programming languages. <br>
	The programming language we used was Swift, an up-and-coming language created by Apple to create peoples' own apps. <br>
	<br>
	Using info from CoderMerlin, a Wiki where anybody can read articles, and anyone with an account can edit them, and a little help from our teacher and Google, us students completed multiple "Merlin Missions," assignments created by the teacher through a CoderMerlin app, and at the end of the year, even our own group projects (Called Independent Study Projects or ISPs despite being group projects) <br>
	Speaking of which...

	ISP
      </h2>
      <p>
      My group's ISP, Polygon Panic, is a Geometry Dash-inspired game. We decided on the concept due to IGIS's limited capabilities and the fact that we all wanted to make a platformer without too much difficulty and disagreement.
