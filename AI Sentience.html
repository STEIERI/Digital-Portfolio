	AI is beneficial, but it's risky. On one hand, if we be over-careful, we might save the our species from a possible disaster, but on the other, our actions might end up being displayed as descriminatory. When being afraid of AI sentience, we must ask ourselves- why? Why let a random possiblility out of many interrupt our daily lives? Why go through the conscious decision to purposely avoid AI? Possibly it has to do with the fear of the unknown. Technology has always advanced in ways that have surprised us, more times than not, and if there is technology that can even act like us, what can we assume? That something will go wrong? Many times in the past has technology gone wrong, but say we screw up in the AI's morality and they end up failing to properly empathize with humans. What then? Because of the power of technology, we have no way of defending ourselves due to how we literally defend ourselves with it, and the alien idea that the technology that goes against us is constantly learning, even? That is a whole iceberg in of itself.
