	About Me
      </h2>
      
      <p>
	I love messing with things, which has caused me to have tons of interests: animating, sketching, skateboarding, singing, gaming, and, of course, programming. I am studying to become a video game designer, due to my fascination of different types of media, I wanted to find a way to combine all of my hobbies together into one large passion. I started my programming "career" when my mom signed me up for Scratch when I was about four. Since then, I have been developing and mastering my skills, even applying non-coding related knowledge to help me understand programming better.

	The Importance of a Portfolio
      </h2>
      
      <p class="blueText">
	Portfolios are a way to display yourself to people, specifically those who might be willing to hire you. By creating your own portfolio, you gain some control in letting them know what you want them to know that would possibly benefit you.
