	Considered Proposals
      </h2>
      
      <p>
	I considered many different ideas, including:
	<ol>
	  <li> <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Deter and Detect Drowsiness Inator </a> <br>
	    A product that uses facial recognition to detect and shock the user when they fall asleep, used for driving and lectures. The product sounds promising due to its assisstance in day to day life; however, I have no knowledge of facial recognition technology, and I don't feel comfortable with creating something that harms people, even if the shock itself may not be harmful.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/sri-nagasai-siva-paladugu/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Search Engine </a> <br>
	    A competitor to Google's search engine, prioritizing privacy. I think it would be great to try a different area of programming; although, I feel like the goal is a bit too ambitious, and I believe, since people are being deterred away from ads more and more, pay-per-click ads may not be the best profit option.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> The Symptoms Quiz </a> <br>
	    A quiz that identifies symptoms and diagnoses you with a common illness. This app is a great alternative to Google's diagnosis system which often makes plenty of assumptions, while the specifications of the quiz make it unique. The simpleness of the programming required is also great. Despite the positives, the project seems like it will either end up being too ambitious or too unspecific due to the amount of common illnesses there are in the world.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/srijishnu-devarapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Project 1984 </a> <br>
	    A scanner that detects students without IDs in schools. I find that the system sounds like it could be quite useful to replace a common nusciance that plagues teachers, but the incredibly low difficulty for a false alarm and the on-the-nose name and general idea that might make people question the safety of students' privacy deters me away from the project.
