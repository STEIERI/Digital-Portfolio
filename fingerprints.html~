      <p class="apaText indent">
	A secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS)  connection aims to both protect the user of a website from being tracked and protect the host of the website from being hacked by requiring the website to send a certificate to a Certificate Authority (CA), proving the website's authenticity. An HTTPS Proxy Appliance, however, can interrupt a "secure" connection to a user and can emulate the website to the user while also tracking them by presenting a fake certificate to the user. This is an example of a man-in-the-middle attack, also called MITM, which threatens the security of both the host and user.
      </p>

      <p class="apaText indent">
	The certificate proving a website is secure is identified by a hash, a group of two digit hexadecimal numbers, which is called the website's fingerprint. Hashes are considered "better" when based upon "SHA1" (Secure Hashing Algorithm 1) compared to "MD5" (Message Digest 5) and when they are longer due to the chance that more digits would change, making it easier to detect when someone makes a fake certificate (i.e. an HTTPS Proxy Appliance).
